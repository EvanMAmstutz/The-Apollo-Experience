### Description
The Apollo Experience, supported by Google Cardboard, depicts the Apollo missions to the moon. Experience a scientifically accurate depiction of the lunar landings. The goal of the game is to follow NASA's directions and explore the lunar environment before its time to return to Earth. Tasks include collecting samples, taking pictures, and planting the American flag.

### Motivation
We wanted to find a moment in history with a lot of significance, which also has many misconceptions. We chose the Apollo moon landing to teach people the facts about the moon including, but not limited to, the lack of stars in the sky, the way the astronauts had to move, and the lack of sound on the moon.
