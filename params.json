{"name":"The Apollo Experience","tagline":"Project two of VR Class","body":"### Description\r\nThe Apollo Experience, supported by Google Cardboard, depicts the Apollo missions to the moon. Experience a scientifically accurate depiction of the lunar landings. The goal of the game is to follow NASA's directions and explore the lunar environment before its time to return to Earth. Tasks include collecting samples, taking pictures, and planting the American flag.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
